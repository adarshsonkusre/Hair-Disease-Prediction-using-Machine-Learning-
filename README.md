# Hair Disease Prediction Algorithm

This Python project implements a hair disease prediction algorithm using machine learning techniques with Keras Sequential method. The algorithm analyzes input data to predict various hair diseases accurately. The code and output files are included for reference.

## Overview

The Hair Disease Prediction Algorithm offers the following features:

- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes Keras Sequential method to build and train a machine learning model for hair disease prediction.

- **Accurate Diagnosis**: The model provides accurate diagnosis of various hair diseases based on input data features.

## Components Used

- Python
- Keras (with Sequential method)
- Input data file (`history.csv`)
- Output file (`VGG19-Final.h5`)

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required dependencies (Keras).
3. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook `hair_disease.ipynb` to view and execute the Python script.

## Usage

1. Prepare input data file `history.csv` with relevant features for hair disease prediction.
2. Run the code cells in the Jupyter Notebook `hair_disease.ipynb` to train the model and generate predictions.
3. Review the output file `VGG19-Final.h5` to load and use the trained model for predicting hair diseases.

## Files Included

- `hair_disease.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python script for training the machine learning model and saving the model in `.h5` format.
- `history.csv`: Input data file containing features for hair disease prediction.
- `VGG19-Final.h5`: Output file containing the trained machine learning model in `.h5` format.
